# ECEV32000-Final-Project

This is a code to take the DNA sequences of the constructs I create 
in lab and print out several parameters of its gene sequence as well
as the protein it codes for. 

The program defines a function constructParam, which takes an argument
constructName that contains a number value (1 - max construct number)
which will return the parameters of that specific construct.
